SUMMARY:Dialogue | Foretold Now opening event with curator Kevin Jones
CLASS:PUBLIC
DESCRIPTION:Join us on Saturday\, 27 July as we launch the Alserkal Avenue 
 summer programme Foretold Now\, curated by arts writer Kevin Jones\, a res
 pected voice on contemporary art and thought in the region. As a preamble 
 to revealing this season’s reading group book—the 1972 novel Roadside 
 Picnic by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky\, to be explored in sessions through
 out the summer—Kevin will raise questions on the human tendency to predi
 ct and forecast. How does the will to foretell haunt our present\, and wha
 t are its manifestations in literature\, visual arts and film?
