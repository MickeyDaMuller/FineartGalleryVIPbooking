<p><strong>New Exhibition Openings<br /> <br /> <em>The Gloomiest Sunset in the World <br /> </em>15 May - 1 September 2019<br /> Opening 15 May | 8-11PM<br /> Carbon 12 | Warehouse 37</strong></p>
<p>Following a global refocus on classical portraiture, Iranian artist Amir Khojaesteh&rsquo;s neo-expressionist work pays homage to tradition through fleshy satire. Zany, political, phantasmagoric, historic, and unavoidably relevant, his body of work engages multiple faculties and epochs, distorted just enough that the line between fantasy and reality leaves viewers in a delicately malevolent twilight zone.</p>
<p><strong><br /> Group Exhibition | <em>Portraits</em><br /> 15 May - 30 June 2019<br /> Opening 15 May | 8-11PM <br /> Showcase | Warehouse 35 </strong></p>
<p>Showcase celebrates the art of portraiture with the work of three talented painters who use different techniques to portray the human figure, capturing both their mood and expression, a moment in time. Featured artists include Iskra Sahaj, Olivia Pendergast, and Victor Sitali.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Shreyas Karle | <em>Exit From the Entrance</em></strong><br /> <strong>15 May - 31 July 2019</strong><br /> <strong>Opening 15 May | 8-11PM </strong><br /> <strong>Grey Noise | Warehouse 24</strong></p>
<p>Shreyas Karle gleans on matters left unattended within the norms of contemporary art practices. His first international solo at Grey Noise, Dubai is an assortment of found/made objects, drawings, prints &amp; video. A part of this exhibition showcases series of screen prints that explore both the desired result and the pleasant accidents, which lend themselves to his visual grammar. Karle&rsquo;s practice focuses largely on identifying form that lies on the periphery of being an object and an artwork. He recognizes the absurdity in a thought, object or an action, translating it into the antithesis of itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Group Exhibition | <em>I Will See it, When I Believe It</em><br /> 15 May - 30 July 2019<br /> Opening 15 May | 8-11PM <br /> The Third Line | Warehouse 78/80</strong></p>
<p>The exhibition will show works by artists Abbas Akhavan, Farhad Moshiri, Hayv Kahraman, Laleh Khorramian, Rana Begum, Slavs and Tatars, and Sophia Al Maria.&nbsp;The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Or is it? Gestalt psychology suggests that in a split second our brain amalgamates the parts of an object or form, and sees a whole. In other words, it turns perception into knowledge. But what happens when the artist disrupts that split second and the transition from perceiving to knowing is stalled? The artists presented have all used the liminal state of perception as a means of questioning what is in fact, known. Each work selected possesses a form of dissonance between the expected and the real, enabling a dialogue between artwork and viewer born out of confusion and failure to see a whole at once.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Group Exhibition | <em>Life Happens</em><br /> 15 May - 30 July 2019<br /> Opening 15 May | 8-11PM <br /> FN Designs | Warehouse 26</strong></p>
<p>The exhibition marks FN Designs&rsquo; 10 year Anniversary, celebrating the diverse art curated by the gallery over the decade and its impact on the art culture in the iconic city of Dubai. Inspired by Life; living by morals and ethics in a culturally diverse, globally influenced region, the artwork focuses on subjects that continue to challenge traditional boundaries. Aiming to provoke and thrill the senses of art collectors, the exhibition will showcase artists who have been contributing to FN Designs remarkable exhibitions over the course of ten years.</p>
