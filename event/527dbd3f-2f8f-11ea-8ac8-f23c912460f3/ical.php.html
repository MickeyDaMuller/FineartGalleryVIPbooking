SUMMARY:Athier - Nothing is Certain\, Everything is Melting\, and that’s 
 Okay
CLASS:PUBLIC
DESCRIPTION:In a departure from the geometric forms and bold colours that h
 ave become a trademark of the British Iraqi painter\, this current series 
 created in and of his studio in an industrial suburb of Paris\, explore th
 e changing state between order and disorder: attempting to capture composi
 tions that balance and eventually melt harmoniously in their state of tran
 sition. This shift can be seen as Athier’s expression of surrender towar
 ds uncertainty. The new works incorporate a play between the real and the 
 surreal\, the two-dimensional\, and the three dimensional. Making colour a
 nd light subjects as well as aesthetic devices.

 

Nothing is Certain\, 
 Everything is Melting\, and that’s Okay\, explores space through careful
 ly curated compositions in which Athier places geometric blocks\, marble s
 labs and rubble\, squiggles\, foam\, plastic toys\, curvilinear objects an
 d patterned forms in a milieu he’s partially designed and partially imag
 ined. Marble melts into plastic\, which melts into water\, which melts int
 o metal: There is no hierarchy of form. These objects exist in a world tha
 t has no mass or gravity\, a world that is light in restrictions. Similar 
 to the previous body of work\, the artist introduces three-dimensional ele
 vations. Within these scenes\, Athier uses old photos of Jean Arp sculptur
 es\, as yet another tool to challenge the viewer to redefine what has form
  and what is flat.  This show features a number of works from an earlier 
 series called All Things Come Apart\, which can be seen as a prelude to th
 e current paintings. Uncertainty\, balance and light have become increasin
 gly instrumental in the artist’s depiction of space.

 

Athier’s com
 positions weave contemporary forms with layers of nostalgia:  Influenced 
 heavily by the Memphis movement of the 1980’s\, the early Italian surrea
 lists and the muted colours and simple forms of early 3D computer graphics
 .  And much like the early surrealists\, the artist maintains a meticulou
 s dedication to believability\, using as many perspective rules as he can 
 within the scenes he creates\, before pulling gravity away and watching th
 em crumble.  All these objects seem to melt into the unknown\, portraying
  a sense of dreamlike uncertainty. And that’s okay.
