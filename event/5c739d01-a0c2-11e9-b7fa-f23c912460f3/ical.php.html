SUMMARY:Summer programme | Foretold Now
CLASS:PUBLIC
DESCRIPTION:From food trends and financial forecasting\, to predicting elec
 tion results and end-of-the-world scenarios\, we have never been more cons
 umed with trying to know what the future holds. Rather than trying to gras
 p what this future is\, Foretold Now examines what drives us to predict in
  the first place. Of course\, the age-old image of the soothsayer has give
 n way to algorithm-powered\, high-precision tools. But the desire to specu
 late seems to be a human constant. What drives this need to prophesy\, and
  what is the fallout of our need to foresee? What are the dangers of specu
 lation\, not just economically\, but emotionally and mentally? How does ou
 r perceived image of future outcomes place unreasonable demands on the pre
 sent? And in spite of all our clamouring to forecast everything from the w
 eather to the apocalypse—rooted perhaps in a (misguided?) will to contro
 l our destinies—to what degree is the future itself 'over-hyped’?
