SUMMARY:Performance | Utopics by Isaac Sullivan
CLASS:PUBLIC
DESCRIPTION:What does apocalypse sound like? How do the affective intensiti
 es that accompany such speculations converse with other dreams of timeless
 ness such as utopia and cosmogony? 

Isaac Sullivanâ€™s recursive performa
 nce\, Utopics\, employs text projections\, sampled music\, and live noise 
 as progressively accumulating layers\, splicing in fragments of its previo
 us recordings to lean into sonic and pictorial decay.
