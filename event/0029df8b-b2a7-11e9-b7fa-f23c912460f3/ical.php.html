SUMMARY:Debate | The Invisible End: Artists and the Apocalypse
CLASS:PUBLIC
DESCRIPTION:Visions of the end of history have always tended towards the su
 blime—the apocalyptic moment in all its fiery\, cataclysmic awe. While t
 he act of seeing and bearing witness has always been fundamental to experi
 encing the 'end times'\, we are increasingly faced with the possibility of
  a more insidious apocalypse\, one that almost escapes visualisation. Data
  and measurement seem to have replaced visual invention. The scientist is 
 perhaps more apt at depicting the conditions of this new apocalypse than t
 he artist. Where do thinkers\, artists and futurologists stand on this sup
 posed bankruptcy of artists’ predictive vision?
