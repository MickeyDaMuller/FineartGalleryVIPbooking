SUMMARY:Contemporary dance  | Game Changer
CLASS:PUBLIC
DESCRIPTION:Where does freedom within limitations lie? Game Changer\, a con
 temporary dance performance by international dance theatre company Aura\, 
 explores this space through live music and monumental costumes. Dancers co
 pe with the limited possibilities of movement\, restricted by their costum
 es created by Dutch installation artist Guda Koster. The huge costumes ref
 lect societal restrains\, and the dancers embody the human beingâ€™s spiri
 t of freedom\, and the desire to break out of the system.
