<p><strong>Invernomuto<br /></strong>Simone Bertuzzi (b. 1983) and Simone Trabucchi (b. 1982) have been collaborating as Invernomuto since 2003. Although their work focuses primarily on the moving image and sound, they also integrate sculpture, performance, and publishing into their practice. Invernomuto explore what remain of sub-cultures by moving through different media. Observed through unashamedly affected eyes, oral cultures, and minor histories are laid open, their vernacular forms examined. Inauthentic materials play a fundamental role within this process, emphasising the fictitious realities that inspire them. Bertuzzi and Trabucchi have developed individual lines of research into sound with the outlets Palm Wine and STILL, respectively. Currently they are developing the project Black Med, initiated for Manifesta 12 (Palermo), which is part of the performance programme at the 58th International Art Exhibition - La Biennale di Venezia, curated by Ralph Rugoff. In 2019, they have held solo shows at Pinksummer, Genoa (April), Leto Gallery, Warsaw (April), NN Contemporary Art, Northampton (June) and Galleria Nazionale, Rome (October).

<p><strong>PAST RESIDENTS</strong></p>
<p><strong>METASITU<br /></strong>METASITU is a research-based and socially-driven practice, pendulating between Kiev and Athens. They usurp artistic roles (artists, curators, coordinators), using art as a strategy: a platform to support their research, a medium to reach different actors, and a tool to establish bridges across disciplines. This allows them to &nbsp;abuse urbanism discourses, develop new tools to empower individuals in the way they relate to the territory, and challenge spatial power hegemonies. Founded in 2014 by Liva Dudareva and Eduardo Cassina, METASITU was born with the goal of enabling cognitive emancipations around the (built) environment, by establishing new formats of knowledge exchange for understanding the urban condition today, for an exciting tomorrow. At &nbsp;METASITU they strive to open up new discursive lines, and demystify prevalent spatial narratives, by curating urbanism festivals, delivering workshops, producing videos, coordinating residencies, developing public programs, tutoring students, self-publishing, and transgressing real estate commodities. For the past three years they have been researching alternatives to traditional master planning techniques for post-industrial shrinking cities. Top-down initiatives such as Detroit&rsquo;s &lsquo;smart decline&rsquo; have proven to be extremely violent and unsuccessful. They believe in creating a horizontal framework for knowledge exchange in order to subsume degrowth in their masterplans.</p>

<h3>2019</h3>
<p><strong>Past Events</strong></p>
<p><strong>29 July 2019 | Lecture-performance by Aarti Sunder</strong></p>
Summer Cycle resident Aarti Sunder explores how we look at an excess of feeling in the workplace and beyond. Her interest is in asking how much these feelings are particular to us as individuals and how much of them are being felt collectively. What it takes to be &lsquo;functional&rsquo; &ndash; within professional spaces and beyond &ndash; and how we repeatedly find ingenious ways to keep our individual and collective neuroses out of working environments (&lsquo;too much feeling&rsquo; is not useful unless channelled as exchange value).
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>25 July 2019 | Isolated Houses</strong></p>
Alserkal resident Sashikanth Thavudoz's invited guests to join him on an excursion investigating the relationships between built environments and nature. Sashikanth translated his personal experiences in Dubai in this off-site visit and through the context of displacement, he used this excursion to explore the temporality of urban experiences.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>24 July 2019 | سُنة الحياة (Norms of life)</strong></p>
Balqis Al Rashed presented two immersive evenings, a Henna and a Wedding Night performance. She describes the performances as: "This marriage is not uniting two people, it is the marriage of dualities, of the bitterness and sweetness of life, the balance of the masculine and the feminine, and the tragedy of death and the celebration of creation. It is simplifying the processes of life by experiencing wedding and funerary ceremonies in a common festive time and space. It is a spectacle where people gather to witness something happen, in order to remember and forget at once."
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>17 July 2019 | Reading The Return of Tipoo's Tiger</strong></p>
Reading the Return of Tipoo&rsquo;s Tiger is a lecture-performance by Raqs Media Collective&rsquo;s Monica Narula (current Alserkal Residency Selection Committee member). The Return of Tipoo&rsquo;s Tiger is a communique from the far future channeled by the Raqs Media Collective. It has man-tigers, machines, and a lexicon of new words and worlds. Imagine an 18th century South Indian automaton of a devouring tiger commissioned by Tipoo Sultan becoming a holy relic in the Europe of 4016 CE - a fetish object worshipped by the future submarine inhabitants of a submarine tunnel. In Raqs&rsquo; media rich lecture-performance, Tipoo&rsquo;s Tiger becomes an uncanny meme for Europe&rsquo;s presence in the world - a fantastical, funny reminder of the ongoing joust between defeat and victory, European and non-European histories, man and nature, human beings and machines.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong> 28 February 2019 | TOWER FISH PIGEON </strong></p>

The performance followed the feeling of assurance created by contractual relations and expectations met by the hospitality industry.

<p><strong>12 November 2018 | Agency &amp; Form; an artist's notes</strong></p>
<p>This screening and discussion led by Fall 2018 resident Yaminay Chaudhri looked at pressing questions related to participatory practice and agency. If an image constitutes an appearance of capital, an outcome of its own time; what kind of agency can it exert on the beholder to create participation? How does this idea scale up to the image of the house, or the image of a city?</p>
<p><strong>12 November 2018 Island Mentality or As Tax-Free as the Undead</strong></p>
<p>Being tied to speculative finance and risk assessment, a tax-free art storage alters the flow of linear time and potentially locks down the future in opposition to a conventional art museum that prevents the past from disappearing. This public talk by Fall 2018 resident followed the abandoned plans for the Dubai Freeport to perform a thought experiment on the possibility of an art practice that might outlast the disappearance of the human sensorium.</p>
<p><strong>24 September 2018 | Institution as Amplifier: Diana Campbell Betancourt on the Samdani Art Foundation</strong></p>

<p><strong>25 July 2018 | Laws of Motion in a Cartoon Landscape</strong></p>
<p>As part of Alserkal Residency's 2018 summer programme, resident Laura Metzler invited artist Andy Holden to present a live performance of his work: Laws of Motion in a Cartoon Landscape. In it, Holden explores the cartoon world via green-screen, proposing 10 laws that govern this realm "where it seems as if anything can happen, yet not anything can." Through his analysis he moves between physics, animation, art history, critical theory and contemporary events to question our perception of the world around us, seeking a new methodology to proceed after the end of art history in a world that is increasingly resembling the cartoon landscape. The 57 minute performance was proceeded by an introduction by Laura Metzler.</p>
<p><strong>23 July 2018 | An Unknown Lover's Discourse</strong></p>
<p>Alserkal Residency Summer 2018 resident Mandy Merzaban presented an artistic intervention that engaged with her ongoing research art project An Unknown Lover's Discourse. The intervention drew on thesis research that investigates subjects such as love, affect and subjectivity in Stefan Zweig's 1922 unrequited love story of Letter from an Unknown Woman and its adaptation over the past century in Egyptian, Hollywood and Chinese film. The programme centered on an audio performance by the resident.</p>
<p><strong>23 September 2018 |Working With, Through, and Beyond institutions: Seminar with Alserkal Residency Selection Committee member Diana Campbell Betancourt</strong></p>
<p>A closed seminar session with Alserkal Residency Selection Committee member Diana Campbell Betancourt. Diana took seminar participants through the text Made to Fit, or The Gathering of the Balloons by Maria Lind and focussed on how artists can work with institutions, using examples of artist-led initiatives from her experience in Bangladesh with the Samdani Art Foundation.</p>
<p><strong>25 July 2018 | Laws of Motion in a Cartoon Landscape</strong></p>
<p>As part of Alserkal Residency's 2018 summer programme, resident Laura Metzler invited artist Andy Holden to present a live performance of his work: Laws of Motion in a Cartoon Landscape. In it, Holden explores the cartoon world via green-screen, proposing 10 laws that govern this realm "where it seems as if anything can happen, yet not anything can." Through his analysis he moves between physics, animation, art history, critical theory and contemporary events to question our perception of the world around us, seeking a new methodology to proceed after the end of art history in a world that is increasingly resembling the cartoon landscape. The 57 minute performance was proceeded by an introduction by Laura Metzler.</p>

<p><strong>16 July 2018 | WE HAVE NEVER BEEN URBAN</strong></p>
<p>Summer 2018 residents Hamed Bukhamseen + Ali Ismail Karimi (Civil Architecture) invited urbanist and author Pierre B&eacute;langer to expand upon an ongoing theme of research which looks to dismantle the political and environmental complexes which have defined landscape in the region over the past century. By uncoupling territory from its colonial vision of fertile, or worked environment, the presentation (and post-lecture conversation moderated with geographer and writer Ahmad Makia) looked towards imagining new ecological, social and political formations for the Middle East. In light of the complete bankruptcy of the architectural as a formal and political project in the Gulf, the conversation tried to imagine new systems, and new natures through which to pose new modes of governance and life.</p>
<p><strong>27 June 2018 | Seminar with Vassilis Oikonomopoulous</strong></p>
<p>Alserkal Residency Selection Committee member Vassilis Oikonomopoulos took pre-registered participants through a series of seminal texts on space including Michel Foucault's Of Other Spaces: Utopias and Heterotopias (1967), Rem Koolhaas' Junkspace (2001) - pp 175 - 190 and poet and critic Quinn Latimer's The Mountain and the Shadow (2017). Vassilis used these texts as a starting point from where to expand on the concerns around the space for contemporary artistic production, the space of the artist, ecosystems and networks, with a loose focus drawn on the specific context of Dubai and what can be learnt from this context, when seen through the prism of these three texts.</p>
<p><strong>14 March 2018 | Sinesiu Kirinis 24</strong></p>
<p>Presented by Spring 2018 resident Kosmas Nikoalaou, Sinesiu Kirinis 24 was a storytelling encounter. Analytical tools like excavation, free association, evidence and witness were used in an abstract way to create an open narration. Findings, leftovers or abandoned items, props, devices, rumours, sayings and spoken words came together to reenact a memory. Sinesiu Kirinis 24 was a short duration guided tour that tried to create different environments and settings. A work in progress the performance was an attempt to work with the idea of the archaeology and the politics of gossip.</p>
<p><strong>11 March 2018 | Screening Programme and Discussion: Anti-Ethnography</strong></p>
<p>Anti-Ethnography is a selection of video works which examine the violence inherent in the ethnographic impulse, and unveils the absurd fetishism underpinning the discipline. Post-screening discussion with filmmaker Adam Khalil, producer Steve Holmgren, and Spring 2018 resident and curator Suzy Halajian.</p>
<p><strong>12 March 2018 | Screening Program and Discussion: INAATE/SE/ [it shines a certain way. to a certain place/it flies. falls./]</strong></p>
<p>Adam Khalil and Zack Khalil's 2016 film re-imagines an ancient Ojibway story, the Seven Fires Prophecy, which both predates and predicts first contact with Europeans. A kaleidoscopic experience blending documentary, narrative, and experimental forms, INAATE/SE/ transcends linear colonized history to explore how the prophecy resonates through the generations in their indigenous community within Michigan's Upper Peninsula. With acute geographic specificity, and grand historical scope, the film fixes its lens between the sacred and the profane to pry open the construction of contemporary indigenous identity.<br />Post-screening discussion with filmmaker Adam Khalil, producer Steve Holmgren, and Spring 2018 resident and curator Suzy Halajian.</p>
<p><strong>4-5 March 2018 | Hydrogen Helium</strong></p>
<p>Hydrogen Helium consisted of a new 10-channel sound installation by Michael John Whelan. A solo voice lists 28 obsolete star constellations that once took the form of animals. Some were recognised for decades, some for centuries, until their deletion in 1922. Each channel is delayed slightly, allowing the names of the constellations to merge, shift and grow together, creating both a cacophony of loss and the birth of a new unrecognisable lexicon. Voice: Cillian Murphy, sound recording: Brian Crosby.</p>
<p><strong>20 February 2018 | Critical Heritage and Participatory Discourses in the UAE</strong></p>
<p>Led by Alserkal Residency Selection Committee member Uzma Z. Rizvi, this talk took a look at the role of art and design in informing the ways in which critical heritage discourse unfolds. Rizvi focussed on projects that provide a platform for participatory discursive action within a threshold at which decolonization problematizes contemporary inequity. This is significant given the high-income nature of the UAE as post-colony with the issues of class upfront, embedded within which are the racialized and gendered forms of transnational labour (both blue- and white-collar). This is not about taking to the streets. It is about maintaining a space of criticality within deep stillness and a quietness. It is about decolonizing moments and slow change.</p>
<h3>2017</h3>
<p><strong>10 December 2017 | Zwischenspiel</strong></p>
<p>Zwischenspiel was series of research-based performance workshops by Fall 2018 resident Ali El-Darsa. The workshops examined gestures as renditions of language, speech, image-making and creative writing. The final performance held at Alserkal Residency Project Space on 10 December 2018 was open to the public.<br />Performers: Hened Choueiry, Sandra Egido Iba&ntilde;ez, Vrushali Kulkarni and Isaac Sullivan.</p>
<p><strong>8 December 2017 | hyper/slow</strong></p>
<p>Alserkal Fall 2017 resident Jaret Vadera led a group of participants on a curated 25-minute silent experience of Dubai and the World Islands by helicopter. It has been said that Dubai is a city designed to be seen from above. But who has access to this perspective? And does zooming out provide a sharper focus or create a deeper abstraction? Is it possible to synchronize with a capitalist frequency of time, and then speed it up, in order to slow it down? Participants were invited to join in this collective experiment by engaging in silence during the helicopter flight, by turning off cell phones, and by refraining from taking any pictures. In an effort to see if we can hack a tourist interface and reprogram it as an artistic or meditative one. Participants were selected at random following an open invitation.</p>
<p><strong>6 December 2017 | Reflections on a cold noodle soup</strong></p>
<p>Raengmyon - a Korean cold noodle dish served in a savoury ice-cold broth. According to a cookbook published in North Korea in 1973, Raengmyon, referred to as the Pyongyang cold noodle soup, is said to have first emerged in the eastern part of the Daedong River district. Made out of buckwheat flour, the noodles are served in a clear cold broth and topped with meat, radish, steamed egg and pepper strips. As part of her Alserkal Residency public programme, Fall 2018 resident Franziska Pierwoss, reflected on the historical relations of the Raengmyon dish in regional contexts.</p>
<p><strong>29 November 2017 | Making Space: Artist-run initiatives and their place in the city</strong></p>
<p>Led by Fall 2018 resident Mona Ayyash, this round table conversation with members from the art community explored how artist-led initiatives in Dubai could take shape while considering obstacles such as rent, money, time, access. The discussion focused on artist-run studio structures, galleries, and cooperatives as potential models to what could possibly work for Dubai.</p>
<p><strong>28 November 2017 | How to do Things with Art: Art and Exhibition Making as Transformative Experiences</strong></p>
<p>Led by Alserkal Residency Selection Committee member Luigi Fassi and moderated by Barjeel Art Foundation Director and Curator Karim Sultan, this talk aimed to reflect upon art and exhibition making as transformative knowledge-sharing formats.</p>
<p><strong>5 November 2017 | Origin Destination: Placing practice in non-place times: Conversations with the inaugural Alserkal Residents 2017</strong></p>
<p>In this talk, Alserkal Residency Selection Committee member Uzma Z. Rizvi was joined by artists Mona Ayyash, Ali El Darsa, Franziska Pierwoss and Jaret Vadera for a broad discussion on their respective practices.</p>
