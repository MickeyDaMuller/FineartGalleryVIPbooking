                    <h3>Fabric(ated) Fractures, a collaboration between the Samdani Art Foundation and Alserkal, opens in Concrete</h3>
                    <p><strong><em>Fabric(ated) Fractures</em></strong><br /> <strong>9-</strong><strong>30 March 2019</strong></p>
<p><strong>Concrete, Alserkal Avenue, Dubai</strong></p>
<p><em>Dubai, </em><em>10 March 2019</em> &ndash; <strong><em><i>Fabric(ated) Fractures</i></em></strong><em>, </em>a collaboration between the Samdani Art Foundation and Alserkal, opened in Concrete on 9 March, with performances by exhibiting artists Ayesha Jatoi, Joydeb Roaja, and Reetu Sattar. The group exhibition, curated by <span>Diana Campbell Betancourt, </span><span>Samda</span><span>ni Art Foundation Artistic Director and Chief Curator of Dhaka Art Summit, </span>features <strong>works by 15 </strong><strong>artists</strong>: Pablo Bartholomew, Kanak Chanpa Chakma, Rashid Choudhury, Rajesh Vangad and Gauri Gill, Shilpa Gupta, Hitman Gurung, Ayesha Jatoi, Ashfika Rahman, Joydeb Roaja, Reetu Sattar, Kamruzzaman Shadhin, Debasish Shom, Jakkai Siributr, and Munem Wasif.</p>
<p>On show until 30 March 2019 in the OMA-designed Concrete in Alserkal Avenue, <em>Fabric(ated) </em><em>Fractures</em> provides a platform to amplify the voices of artists from Bangladesh and South and Southeast Asia, and explores &lsquo;sensitive spaces&rsquo;&mdash;spaces that challenge ideas of nation, state, and territory. <span>The exhibition design </span><span>intervenes in the</span><span> architecture of Concrete</span><span>, </span><span></span><span>spanning its height with community</span><span>-</span><span>based art</span><span>works that are humanist acts of insurgency against rising polari</span><span>s</span><span></span><span>ation in the region (and the rest of the world</span><span>)</span><span>, and grounding the exhibition in a more porous pre-colonial past through the use of a </span><span>vernacular</span><span> mud floor found in many South Asian villages.</span></p>
<p>Vilma Jurkute, Alserkal Director, says, &ldquo;The opening of <em>Fabric(ated) Fractures </em>in Concrete brings a longstanding collaboration between Alserkal and the Samdani Art Foundation to life. This milestone exhibition builds on Alserkal&rsquo;s mandate to support regional talent, as well as to further foster a growing South to South dialogue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span>Dhaka Art Summit is a continuous exercise in challenging how the world sees Bangladesh and how Bangladesh sees itself</span>,&rdquo; says <span>Diana </span>Campbell Betancourt<span>, Curator of the exhibition</span>. &ldquo;<span>I&rsquo;m delighted that we are able </span><span>to </span><span>extend this conversation </span><span>through this project in</span><span> Dubai</span><span>, both through the exhibition as well as the powerful performance program</span><span>me</span><span> which </span><span>puts the human at the cent</span><span>re</span><span></span><span> of </span><span>the exhibition through poetic artistic gestures by Ayesha Jatoi, Reetu Sattar, and Joydeb Roaja</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While this exhibition was born within the borders of what is now considered Bangladesh, <span style="font-style: normal !msorm;"><em><span>Fabric(ated) Fractures </span></em></span><span>examines how </span>the lines demarcating this young country are constantly shifting. The waters that move across <span>Bangladesh&rsquo;s </span>edges are shared with India and Myanmar, flowing into wider border issues that extend into Thailand, Pakistan, and Nepal&mdash;the countries that the 15 artists in this exhibition come from. Their works break down reductive national and regional narratives, and reformulate them from a more local and human perspective. Regional lenses, including overarching headers such as &lsquo;South Asia&rsquo; or &lsquo;MENASA&rsquo;, tend to filter out the many traces of difference found on a local level, and this exhibition aims to weave a more complex picture of the vibrant and diverse threads that comprise a yet-to-be crystalised identity in the wounded border areas related to Bangladesh&mdash;which cannot be defined with a single regional framing device.</p>
<p>The militarisation of the Chittagong Hill Tracts inspires the drawings of <strong>Joydeb Roaja</strong>, who comes from the indigenous Tripura community. The military motifs from the <em>Generation Wish Yielding Trees and Atomic Tree </em>series are reflected in his <em>alpona </em>installation in The Yard in Alserkal Avenue, which can be viewed throughout the duration of the exhibition. Through his work,<strong> Pablo Bartholomew</strong> traces the links between geographically fractured indigenous Chakma communities (ethnic minorities in Myanmar, India, and Bangladesh), weaving together science, myth, legend, and tradition to explore a cross-border ethnic identity in an installation comprised of photographs and woven textiles. The Bangladeshi Chakma artist <strong>Kanak Chanpa Chakma</strong> revisits the &lsquo;Ramu Incident&rsquo; through her series of paintings, <em>Soul Piercing, </em>juxtaposing photographic documentation and newspaper clippings from the 2012 incident against imagery of peaceful Buddhist architecture.</p>
<p><span>Speaking to the potential found in seeing</span><span> through </span><span></span><span>multiple points of view, t</span>he late <strong>Rashid Choudhury&rsquo;s</strong> majestic woven tapestries allude to village life in Bengal prior to externally introduced religious divides, and teem with movement, referencing pluralistic rituals of celebration and worship<span>. Similarly,</span> <strong>Rajesh Vangad</strong> and <strong>Gauri Gill</strong>&rsquo;s <em>Fields of Sight </em>series bring to question the politics of landscape as the site through which trauma is registered, providing overlapping and <span>varying perspectives</span> onto the same landscape.</p>
<p><strong>Hitman G</strong><strong>urung&rsquo;s</strong> ongoing series <em>This is My Home, My Land and My Country </em>addresses the conflicted history between the Tharu indigenous community of the Terai region of Nepal and the government, and <strong>Ayesha Jatoi</strong>&rsquo;s <em>Residue</em>, which the artist performed on opening night, explores a metaphorically burdened act in uncertain times of putting away the remnants of love, longing, and loss. Jatoi will perform the piece again on 18 March at 7.15PM at Concrete. <strong>Ashfika Rahman</strong>&rsquo;s powerful portrait series, <em>Rape is Political</em>, depicts rape victims in the Khagrachari hills area, located at the militarised border between India, Bangladesh, and Myanmar, where state administrative machinery is used to protect rapists.</p>
<p><strong>Reetu Sattar</strong> performed <em>Harano Sur (Lost Tune</em>) on opening night, a piece that focuses on the harmonium, a musical instrument that is tightly integrated into the traditional culture of Bangladesh, but is in danger of disappearing. A film documents a performance that brought together musicians, each playing three notes of the seven notes of the harmonium as part of the exhibition. The performance will take place again on 18 March at 7PM. <strong>Kamruzzaman Shadhin&rsquo;s </strong>installation <em>Haven is Elsewhere </em>was created through a large-scale action: a year and a half spent exchanging the clothes of refugees at Bangladesh&rsquo;s southern border with Southeast Asia for new garments. The refugees&rsquo; clothes were joined into a monumental piece of fabric embellished with traditional Bangladeshi <em>kantha </em>embroidery.</p>
<p>The Indian artist <strong>Shilpa Gupta</strong>&rsquo;s work, which debuted at the 2014 Dhaka Art Summit, addresses <em>chitmahals</em>&mdash;former landlocked islands of India within Bangladesh, and Bangladesh within India&mdash; reflecting on the long-standing relationship between &lsquo;illegal&rsquo; people and their ancestral land. <strong>Debasish S</strong><strong>hom</strong>&rsquo;s body of work, <em>In the Rivers Dark</em>, speaks to the fear of displacement and the desire to hold on to home, no matter how dark and dangerous the circumstances surrounding it are. Through his work <em>The Outlaw&rsquo;s Flag</em>, Thai artist<strong> Jakkai Siributr</strong> provides a critical perspective on rising communal tensions and Buddhist-Muslim relations in South and Southeast Asia, which have become intensified by the mass movements of populations. <strong>Munem Wasif&rsquo;s</strong> haunting series of black and white photographs of the blurred boundary of Bangladesh and India, <em>Land of Undefined Territory</em>, conceals the intense human interaction within its surface.</p>

<p><strong><span>Diana Campbell Betancourt<br /></span></strong><span>Diana Campbell Betancourt is a Princeton educated American curator who has been working in South and Southeast Asia since 2010 - primarily in India, Bangladesh, and the Philippines - and is now based between Brussels and Dhaka. Since 2013, she has served as the Founding Artistic Director of the Samdani Art Foundation and Chief Curator of the Dhaka Art Summit, leading the critically acclaimed 2014, 2016, and 2018 editions. Campbell has developed the Dhaka Art Summit into a leading research and exhibitions platform for art from South Asia, bringing together artists, architects, curators, and writers from across South Asia through a largely commission based model where new work and exhibitions are born in Bangladesh, and has realised significant projects with artists such as Raqib Shaw (co-curated with Maria Balshaw), Tino Seghal, Lynda Benglis, Raqs Media Collective, Shahzia Sikander, Shilpa Gupta, Haroon Mirza, and many others through this unique platform. In addition to her exhibitions making practice, Campbell is responsible for developing the Samdani Art Foundation collection and drives its international collaborations ahead of opening the foundation&rsquo;s permanent home, Srihatta - Samdani Art Centre and Sculpture Park, opening in Sylhet in early 2019.</span></p>
<p><span>Concurrent to her work in Bangladesh from June 2016-June 2018, Campbell Betancourt was also the Founding Artistic Director of Bellas Artes Projects in the Philippines, a non-profit international residency and exhibition programme with sites in Manila and Bataan where she curated Bruce Conner&rsquo;s first major solo exhibition in Asia as well exhibitions of new work by artists such as Pawel Althamer, Cian Dayrit, Isabel and Alfredo Aquilizan, among others. She remains an advisor to Bellas Artes Projects, and she chairs the board of the Mumbai Art Room, one of India&rsquo;s leading non-profit spaces. In 2018, she was appointed curator of Frieze Projects in London. Her writing has been published by Mousse, Frieze, Art in America, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) among others.</span></p>
