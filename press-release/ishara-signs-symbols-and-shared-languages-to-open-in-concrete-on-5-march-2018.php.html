<p><span><strong><em>Ishara: Signs, Symbols and Shared Languages</em></strong></span><span><strong> to open in Concrete on 5 March 2018</strong></span></p>
<p><span>A partnership between Alserkal Programming and UAE Unlimited, the exhibition will showcase the works of 10 UAE-based emerging artists</span></p>

<p><span><strong><em>Dubai, United Arab Emirates.</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span>Alserkal Programming and UAE Unlimited will bring </span><span><strong><em>Ishara: Signs, Symbols and S</em></strong></span><span><strong><em>hared L</em></strong></span><span><strong><em>anguages</em></strong></span><span> to Concrete in March 2018. The show will run from 5 March to 1 April. Curated by Karim Sultan, the exhibition will feature new works by 10 UAE-based artists, in addition to loaned works by guest </span><span><strong>artists Ramin Haerizadeh, Rokni Haerizadeh and Hesam Rahmanian</strong></span><span>. The </span><span><strong>selected artists for the 2018 edition</strong></span><span> of UAE Unlimited are Amna Al Dabbagh, Cheb Moha, Chndy, Dina Khorchid, Farah Al Qasimi, Flounder Lee, Nasir Nasrallah, Saba Qizilbash, Salem Al Mansoori, and Shaikha Al Ketbi. </span></p>
<p><span>The concept of the exhibition is derived from a broad understanding of the meaning and use of language. In Arabic, </span><span><em>Ishara</em></span><span>, denotes &ldquo;sign&rdquo;&mdash;the most basic form of communication, and refers to the linguistic marks, gestures and indications, as well as commonly used signals that transcend language, like those used in traffic or urban spaces. The curatorial process for the exhibition has been thematically informed by the idea of &ldquo;lingua franca,&rdquo; which hints at constructed, second or third languages that were used to aid communication between various groups or in situations where communication was difficult. </span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;In the context of the UAE, with its major port cities, this leads to an intrinsic interest in this mediated form of communication, where numerous languages are assembled together in trade, transportation, and interpersonal relationships. A broader view incorporates body language and infrastructure, where signs create paths but also erect barriers, where appearances or dialects signal the existence of certain publics but preclude others&rdquo;, says Sultan.</span></p>
<p><span>The selection of the artists was based on their ability to create works that dealt with the structure-building involved in language, or a tendency towards works that address the subject of communication. Often this manifests itself in works that simultaneously deal with the technologies of communication (both artificial and otherwise), the construction of new languages, and the translation of memory into works that attempt to communicate. </span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;These 10 locally-based artists each bring a highly individual practice to the exhibition, realised through media such as video, installation, found objects, and drawing. The incredible range of the exhibition will reflect Concrete&rsquo;s adaptability and breadth. It is the ideal platform to showcase the work of these artists, to audiences from the UAE and beyond.&rdquo; says Vilma Jurkute, Director of Alserkal Avenue.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><u>&nbsp;</u></p>
<p><span>Shobha Pia Shamdsani, Executive Director of UAE Unlimited says, &ldquo;Since our inception, it has been part of our mandate at UAE Unlimited to support emerging UAE-based artists, to help get them on a regional and international stage, but also to create a culture of mentorship, guidance and peer learning that will provide a lasting impact on the development of their work. The regular reading sessions with the curator and guest artists provide an important opportunity for in-depth mentoring, as for some </span><span><em>Ishara</em></span><span> will be the first time that they have participated in a curator-led group show.&rdquo; </span></p>
<p><span>The Dubai-based guest artists, Ramin Haerizadeh, Rokni Haerizadeh, and Hesam Rahmanian, provide an important role mentoring the commissioned artists and providing insight into their practices, a format that UAE Unlimited has adopted since its inception in 2015. Their exhibition experience is supplemented by their engaged and highly disciplined shared practices, which incorporate painting, sculpture, a variety of found and assembled media, video, and more. The cultural, and scholarly references they often cite will lend a unique literary asset to the selected artists. The mentorship extends to the curator as well; Sharjah-based curator, Laura Metzler, is senior curatorial advisor on the exhibition. </span></p>
<p><span>With the aim of supporting UAE-based emerging artists, not only in growing their practice, but in bringing them to the attention of a global audience, UAE Unlimited has established a practice of selecting emerging contemporary artists for its annual exhibitions. The artists produce work under the guidance of guest artists, creating a culture of mentorship within the arts community and specifically in the exhibition. </span></p>

<p><span><strong>Ramin Haerizadeh, Rokni Haerizadeh and Hesam Rahmanian</strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Ramin Haerizadeh (born 1975, Tehran), Rokni Haerizadeh (born 1978, Tehran) and Hesam Rahmanian (born 1980, Knoxville) have lived and worked together in Dubai since 2009. They work independently and together propagating a form of collaboration that doesn&rsquo;t suppress individualism. The seeds of their language were sown as early as 1999 in Iran. Their practice offers up a novel redefinition of the collective, as theirs is constantly growing and contracting to incorporate friends, writers, and artists at large. It entails the use of both low and high art references, and freely embraces &lsquo;what is considered marginal, wasted, wrong, messed up, useless, and taken for granted&rsquo;. Their individual practices differ stylistically while political and social commentary become inherently subversive in a common reflection. The exhibitions they conceive are as much insights into their daily practice which they designate as the ritual of living and working together. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Their immersive and multimedia installations build upon their perception of life as a theatre while also making their process visible. Generally, their proposals begin with the &lsquo;creatures&rsquo; that the three artists become, both physically and mentally, and whose very beings are the roles that are eventually played. Placing emphasis on the importance of &lsquo;reporting on our time&rsquo;, they wish to bring attention to the urgencies of the present moment while opening up questions over a spectrum of subjects such as views on art and culture, gender fluidity, and power mechanisms. &lsquo;The conglomeration of things actually asks us to look at what is in front of us&rsquo; comment the artists, demanding time for contemplation. The artists seek to encourage the viewer to recognise the reality of interdependency and the value of solidarity with others. Therefore, they create a sense of alienation or estrangement from reality with depersonalised individual subjects (creatures) and inhomogeneous crafted objects. In doing so, they aim to exorcise the sentimentalism, resulting in an emotional distance to elicit from the viewer astonishment rather than empathy and ultimately allowing for critical analysis. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Recipients of the Han Nefkens Foundation/MACBA Award, the artists will stage a solo exhibition at the MACBA in Barcelona in October 2017. Recent solo exhibitions include&nbsp;</span><span><em>The Birthday Party</em></span><span>&nbsp;(2015) at the Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA) in Boston,&nbsp;</span><span><em>Slice A Slanted Arc Into Dry Paper Sky&nbsp;</em></span><span>at the Zurich Kunsthalle (2015),&nbsp;</span><span><em>Those Who Love Spiders, and Let Them Sleep in Their Hair</em></span><span>&nbsp;at Den Frie Centre of Contemporary Art in Copenhagen (2015) and&nbsp;</span><span><em>Another Happy Day</em></span><span>&nbsp;(2017) at the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi. They also participated in&nbsp;</span><span><em>The Restless Earth</em></span><span>&nbsp;(2017) for the Milan Triennale in association with Fondazione Nicola Trussardi and contributed to the National Pavilion of the UAE at the 57th Venice Biennale's catalogue as an extended site of the exhibition. They took part in the Liverpool Biennale (2016), and the 8th Asia Pacific Triennial of Contemporary Art at the Queensland Gallery in Brisbane (2015).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A facsimile of their artist book&nbsp;</span><span><em>Her Majesty?</em></span><span>&nbsp;was published by Editions Patrick Frey in 2016 and a monograph of their work&nbsp;</span><span><em>Ramin Haerizadeh Rokni Haerizadeh Hesam Rahmanian</em></span><span>&nbsp;was published by Mousse Publishing in 2015.</span></p>
