                    <p><strong>Alserkal Programming and UAE Unlimited announce partnership to showcase UAE-based artists at Concrete</strong></p>
<p><em>Curated by Karim Sultan, with Ramin Haerizadeh, Rokni Haerizadeh and Hesam Rahmanian named as guest artists, the show will take place from 5 March until 1 April 2018</em></p>
<h6>&nbsp;</h6>
<p><strong>Dubai, 27 September 2017</strong></p>
<p>Alserkal Programming has announced a partnership with UAE Unlimited to create the 2018 edition of the annual exhibition that showcases the work of emerging UAE-based artists. The exhibition, curated by Sharjah-based artist and curator Karim Sultan, will take place in <em>Concrete</em> from 5 March to 1 April 2018.</p>
<p>Following the unique format of mentorship that UAE Unlimited has adopted since its inception in 2015, Dubai-based artists Ramin Haerizadeh<em>, </em>Rokni Haerizadeh and Hesam Rahmanian have been selected as guest artists and will work in an advisory capacity with emerging artists from the UAE to develop new artworks for the exhibition. The guest artists live and work together out of their Dubai-based studio and are known for their ingenious use of materials, working across various mediums. Their practice resonates strongly with young artists from across the UAE.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His Highness Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan bin Khalifa Al Nahyan and Abdelmonem Bin Eisa Alserkal have a shared vision of nurturing and supporting emerging artists from the UAE. Their commitment to the arts is reflected in the work of UAE Unlimited and Alserkal Programming respectively. We look forward to bringing the immense talent of contemporary artists and curators from the UAE to <em>Concrete</em> &mdash; a multi-disciplinary space that was designed with museum-grade exhibitions in mind,&rdquo; said Vilma Jurkute, Director of Alserkal Avenue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The partnership between Alserkal Programming and UAE Unlimited will not only offer emerging UAE-based artists the opportunity to work with more established artists to create works of relevance to the local area, but they will also have their work shown in a world-class exhibition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alserkal Programming&rsquo;s commitment to the UAE&rsquo;s art scene has made this partnership a natural one; the organisation has made an indelible contribution to artists and curators in the UAE. A space like <em>Concrete</em> raises the bar for the artists and curators in the region, giving them the freedom to create innovative works,&rdquo; said Shobha Pia Shamdsani, Executive Director of UAE Unlimited.</p>
<p>The emphasis on learning and exchange extends to the curator as well; Laura Metzler, a respected UAE-based curator, has been named senior advisor on the project to assist Sultan and provide guidance through the six-month-long process. The exhibition will feature works by the guest artists as well as new commissions by selected emerging artists from the UAE.</p>
<p>In keeping with previous years, the March 2018 exhibition has a central theme &mdash; language and its use as a medium for communication. The theme aims to enable artists to create works that engage with the development of shared languages.</p>
<p>Explaining the significance of the theme, Sultan, who is also the director of Barjeel Art Foundation in Sharjah, said, &ldquo;When an artist uses language in their work, they cannot assume that their audience will understand a particular reference, or share the same language as them. The artists in this exhibition will be challenged to produce works that negotiate spoken, written, and visual languages, and that take into account a multiplicity of visual and cultural histories, and experiences of home and migration.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Concrete</em> &ndash; a multi-purpose and multi-disciplinary space &mdash; was conceptualised as an adaptable venue, and designed by Office for Metropolitan Architecture (OMA). Its ability to accommodate a wide range of artistic mediums makes it the ideal location for the show, which aims to feature a diverse range of visual arts disciplines, from paintings to multimedia art.</p>
<p>UAE Unlimited, supported by His Highness Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan bin Khalifa Al Nahyan, is a platform focused on nurturing the new generation of Emirati and UAE-based artists. The platform aims to support artists by assisting them in the creation and production of new projects alongside organising exhibitions to provide them with national and international exposure and opportunities for wider representation at this stage in their careers.</p>

<p><span><strong>Biographies</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>His Highness Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan bin Khalifa Al Nahyan<br /> <br /> </strong></p>
<p>His Highness Sheikh Zayed, (b. 1988) is the grandson of the President of the UAE, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al Nahyan. He graduated from the University of St. Andrews, Scotland, UK, receiving his Master of Arts with Honours in Middle East Studies and Modern History. With a keen interest, and a sense of duty to enhance the civic life of his country, Sheikh Zayed has sought to develop the artistic and creative voices of emerging generations, and support their efforts to enrich the cultural life of the UAE.</p>
<p>With this ideal in mind, HH Sheikh Zayed has garnered his talents and interests to become, at 29, one of the youngest, and most prominent patrons of the arts in the UAE. He is a keen collector of Middle Eastern Art, both Modern &amp; Contemporary, and including works from India, Iran &amp; Turkey. In 2015, he established UAE Unlimited (formerly UAE Unlimited Arab Exploration), an open exhibition platform committed to the promotion of his country&rsquo;s creative and artistic wellspring; within the UAE and internationally. UAE Unlimited is now in its third year of operation and has successfully begun its mission to positively impact the life and career of emerging artists. HH Sheikh Zayed is a Patron of the Centre Pompidou &amp; the British Museum, and is on their Middle Eastern Acquisition Committees. He is also a Patron of the Sharjah Art Foundation and Honorary Patron of Art Dubai. Sheikh Zayed and UAE Unlimited have generously donated artworks from prominent UAE artists including Mohammed Kazem, Mohammed Ibrahim Al Mansoori and Ammar Al Attar to the Centre Pompidou and the British Museum.</p>
<p>HH Sheikh Zayed also serves on the Board of the Make A Wish Foundation-UAE Chapter and is Chairman of the Sultan bin Khalifa al Nahyan Humanitarian and Scientific Foundation, and is Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Sultan bin Khalifa Thalassemia Award.<br /><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Abdelmonem Bin Eisa Alserkal </strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Founder of Alserkal Avenue, Alserkal Programming and Alserkal Residency, and patron of the arts&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Abdelmonem is the driving force behind Alserkal Avenue, a cultural destination that houses the most prominent contemporary art galleries in the region. In 2015, he launched Alserkal Programming, the not-for-profit arm of Alserkal Avenue, which supports locally-based and international artists through commissions and public programmes. As a natural extension of the programming arm, Abdelmonem established Alserkal Residency in early 2017. The Residency is designed to give artists, writers, curators, and researchers the opportunity to critically reflect on and experiment with their practice within the context of Dubai.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Concrete&nbsp;</em>opened<em>&nbsp;</em>in Alserkal Avenue in 2017, commissioned by Abdelmonem Alserkal and designed to be a space for alternative programmes and museum-grade exhibitions. <em>Concrete</em> is the first building to be completed in the UAE by the Office for Metropolitan Architecture (OMA), which was founded by Pritzker Prize-winner Rem Koolhaas.</p>
<p>Featured in <em>Surface</em> magazine's 2016 Power 100, Abdelmonem serves on numerous boards of prestigious art institutions around the world, including the British Museum's Contemporary and Modern Middle Eastern Art Acquisition Group; the Tate's Middle East and North Africa Acquisition Committee; and the Guggenheim's Middle Eastern Circle. Abdelmonem and the Alserkal family have long been supporters of the arts and have been awarded the Patron of the Arts award twice, in 2012 and 2013, by HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai.</p>

<p><span><strong>Ramin Haerizadeh, Rokni Haerizadeh and Hesam Rahmanian</strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Ramin Haerizadeh (born 1975, Tehran), Rokni Haerizadeh (born 1978, Tehran) and Hesam Rahmanian (born 1980, Knoxville) have lived and worked together in Dubai since 2009. They work independently and together propagating a form of collaboration that doesn&rsquo;t suppress individualism. The seeds of their language were sown as early as 1999 in Iran. Their practice offers up a novel redefinition of the collective, as theirs is constantly growing and contracting to incorporate friends, writers, and artists at large. It entails the use of both low and high art references, and freely embraces &lsquo;what is considered marginal, wasted, wrong, messed up, useless, and taken for granted&rsquo;. Their individual practices differ stylistically while political and social commentary become inherently subversive in a common reflection. The exhibitions they conceive are as much insights into their daily practice which they designate as the ritual of living and working together. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Their immersive and multimedia installations build upon their perception of life as a theatre while also making their process visible. Generally, their proposals begin with the &lsquo;creatures&rsquo; that the three artists become, both physically and mentally, and whose very beings are the roles that are eventually played. Placing emphasis on the importance of &lsquo;reporting on our time&rsquo;, they wish to bring attention to the urgencies of the present moment while opening up questions over a spectrum of subjects such as views on art and culture, gender fluidity, and power mechanisms. &lsquo;The conglomeration of things actually asks us to look at what is in front of us&rsquo; comment the artists, demanding time for contemplation. The artists seek to encourage the viewer to recognise the reality of interdependency and the value of solidarity with others. Therefore, they create a sense of alienation or estrangement from reality with depersonalised individual subjects (creatures) and inhomogeneous crafted objects. In doing so, they aim to exorcise the sentimentalism, resulting in an emotional distance to elicit from the viewer astonishment rather than empathy and ultimately allowing for critical analysis. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Recipients of the Han Nefkens Foundation/MACBA Award, the artists will stage a solo exhibition at the MACBA in Barcelona in October 2017. Recent solo exhibitions include&nbsp;<em>The Birthday Party</em>&nbsp;(2015) at the Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA) in Boston,&nbsp;<em>Slice A Slanted Arc Into Dry Paper Sky&nbsp;</em>at the Zurich Kunsthalle (2015),&nbsp;<em>Those Who Love Spiders, and Let Them Sleep in Their Hair</em>&nbsp;at Den Frie Centre of Contemporary Art in Copenhagen (2015) and&nbsp;<em>Another Happy Day</em>&nbsp;(2017) at the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi. They also participated in&nbsp;<em>The Restless Earth</em>&nbsp;(2017) for the Milan Triennale in association with Fondazione Nicola Trussardi and contributed to the National Pavilion of the UAE at the 57th Venice Biennale's catalogue as an extended site of the exhibition. They took part in the Liverpool Biennale (2016), and the 8th Asia Pacific Triennial of Contemporary Art at the Queensland Gallery in Brisbane (2015).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A facsimile of their artist book&nbsp;<em>Her Majesty?</em>&nbsp;was published by Editions Patrick Frey in 2016 and a monograph of their work&nbsp;<em>Ramin Haerizadeh Rokni Haerizadeh Hesam Rahmanian</em>&nbsp;was published by Mousse Publishing in 2015.</p>
