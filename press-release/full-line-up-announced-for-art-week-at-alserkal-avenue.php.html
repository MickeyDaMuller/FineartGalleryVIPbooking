<p>Art Week at Alserkal Avenue will kick off on 9 March with the opening of <em>Syria: Into the Light</em>, a show featuring more than 60 works by Syrian masters and emerging artists, from the collection of the Atassi Foundation, a non-profit initiative that focuses on Syrian art and culture.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Alserkal Programming</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Alserkal Programming</strong> commissions during Art Week will focus on local talent and the theme of &lsquo;work&rsquo;. The four commissions are by UAE-based artists Farah Al Qasimi, Ammar Al Attar, Karim Sultan, and Raja&rsquo;a Khalid. Each of the artists will produce work that is inspired by the physical, social and cultural framework of Alserkal Avenue and its surrounding industrial neighbourhood of Al Quoz in Dubai.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Majlis Talks</strong></span></p>
<p>Art Week at Alserkal Avenue continues through 18 March with a line-up that includes <strong>Majlis Talks</strong>, taking place most days in The Yard between 4pm &ndash; 6pm. Art Week will also feature a diverse programme of workshops, film screenings and book launches that are open to the public. Screenings include <em>Barakah Meets Barakah (2016)</em> and <em>Play it Again Sam (1972)</em>, which is part of the screening programme for <em>Plaza Cinema</em>, Ammar Al Attar&rsquo;s Alserkal Programming commission that reflects on the cultural impact of one of Dubai&rsquo;s first movie-houses.</p>

<p>Alongside the activities for Art Week, Alserkal Avenue will also be launching Folio, a platform on the Alserkal Avenue website that will be a collection of essays, features, podcasts and videos that document the ever-growing and evolving creative scene of the MENASA region. Notes from our journeys across the region and beyond combine with stories that explore our incredible contemporary art galleries, creative concepts and entrepreneurs within the Avenue.</p>
<p><strong>Vilma Jurkute, Director of Alserkal Avenue</strong> remarks, &ldquo;While contemporary art has always been at the heart of Alserkal Avenue, our commitment is to all forms of creative expression. This can be seen in the diversity of talent on show during Art Week this year, but also in the launch of <em>Concrete</em> - a space designed to house international-level, museum-grade exhibitions and inspired creative concepts.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Alserkal Programming Commissions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ammar Al Attar&rsquo;s</strong> project <em>Plaza Cinema</em> stems from the artist&rsquo;s efforts to rescue old filmstrips, movie posters and ephemera from decommissioned theatres in the UAE. These aging movie-houses are touchstones of Dubai&rsquo;s modern history and places of deep personal meaning and memory for residents. In January 2017, Al Attar recreated a series of thirty movie posters from Plaza Cinema, a recently shuttered theatre in Bur Dubai, as a prelude to his project. In March, the artist presents an installation of the materials he rescued, providing a rare opportunity to analyse and consider how film often connects diverse migrant communities &ndash; many of whom are in the UAE for work &ndash; with narratives and images of home.</p>
<p><em>Different Air</em> is a three-part commission by <strong>Karim Sultan</strong> that explores notions of movement, migration, and the physical experience and trauma of deterioration and loss of memory. The project&rsquo;s third iteration will be presented in March, concluding a trilogy of performances that examine the increasing distance between an individual who leaves home and the difficulties they face retaining memories accurately and performing them meaningfully as they drift further and further away, geographically and chronologically.</p>
<p><strong>Farah Al Qasimi&rsquo;s</strong> <em>It&rsquo;s Not Easy Being Seen</em> is a two-part commission that explores the invisible labour of women in the cycle of creation and consumption, through the mediums of photography, performance and video. The first element presented in November 2016 was a billboard in The Yard at Alserkal Avenue; the second element presented in March 2017, will include a series of short videos that explore the effects of capitalism on the female body, and reference the intimate relation between artistic labour and creative production.</p>
<p><strong>Raja&rsquo;a Khalid</strong> will debut <em>Change Your Life</em>, which critiques a fashionable practice of performative masculinity (i.e. working out) and places it as a contemporary motif of religiosity. A moving tableau, the commission consists of a gym, which will be open for five weeks to pre-selected young, male fitness professionals where they will participate in a workout regimen. The installation looks carefully at the arts neighbourhood&rsquo;s proximity to an increasing number of fitness centres within the framework theorised by Peter Sloterdijk in his 2013 book <em>You Must Change Your Life</em> in which the German philosopher tracks the history and philosophy of practice and discipline. By making their connections more explicit Khalid's commission exposes the blurring between the potentially aesthetic, ascetic and athletic demands of contemporary life in the Gulf.</p>

<p>ARTISTS&rsquo; BIOGRAPHIES</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ammar Al Attar</span> <br /> Born in 1981, Ammar Al Attar lives in Ajman in the United Arab Emirates. Completely self-taught, Al Attar&rsquo;s practice as a photographer and mixed-media artist, seeks to not only document and translate but also methodically research and examine aspects of Emirati ritual, material culture, and geographic orientation that are increasingly illusive in his rapidly globalising society. Al Attar often incorporates retro photographic equipment into his shoots. He hoards everything from slide projectors to large format cameras, dog-eared postcards and orphaned negatives and meticulously catalogues these clues to the past on the shelves of his Sharjah studio. His ongoing research project, Reverse Moments, a collaboration with various long time studio photographers, collects stories and artifacts that compose the history of photography in the UAE, and curates these flashes into a critical emerging narrative. Al Attar&rsquo;s work has been increasingly shown within the UAE and Gulf, and is held in prestigious public and private collections including Sharjah Art Foundation, Barjeel Art Foundation, and Maraya Art Centre, the forthcoming Zayed National Museum, amongst others.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Karim Sultan</span><br /> Born in Kuwait and now living in Dubai, Karim Sultan is an artist and curator. A graduate of York University in Toronto, Karim creates experimental electronica- based sound art that is imbued with Arab and regional influences. The work acts as a kind of travelogue that narrates his journeys, both physically and metaphorically. Karim performed at the 2015 Shubbak Festival of Contemporary Arab Culture in London and is the founding editor of Kalimat magazine, the non-profit publication that is committed to open expression for Arab creatives worldwide. He plays the oud, the Arabic stringed instrument similar to the lute. Karim is also currently the curator at Barjeel Art Foundation.</p>

<p>Born in Saudi Arabia in 1984, Raja&rsquo;a Khalid is an artist from Dubai. She received her MFA in Fine Art from Cornell University, where she was also the recipient of the Cornell Council for the Arts Grant in 2013. Her practice is concerned with the Arabian Gulf region and its narratives of class, ultra luxury and consumer&nbsp;culture. Her current work looks at the Gulf&rsquo;s streaming motifs of soft power alongside frequently encountered notions of masculinity, athleticism, sport, adornment, desire and crypto-secularity. Recent awards and residencies include the NYU Abu Dhabi FIND Research Fellowship, 2014; the Künstlerhaus Büchsenhausen International Fellowship for Art and Theory, 2015; the Rijksakademie van Beeldende Kunsten Guest Residency, 2015; and the International Curatorial and Studio Program Residency, 2015. Her work has been shown in New York, London, Dubai, Basel and Vienna.</p>
